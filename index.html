              This principle helps depict an object's mass and momentum, 
              stretching the object's form as it accelerates, and then flattening and 
              widening as it decelerates. Imagine a rubber ball bouncing on a hard floor, 
              flattening out before springing away back up into the air.

              Think of anticipation as visual foreshadowing of an action to 
              come. A cat coiling and wriggling before pouncing. Cocking an arm back before 
              throwing a ball. Robots move from position to position. Creatures rely on 
              preliminary motion to help gain leverage and power. Movement without 
              anticipation can seem stale and artificial.

              Staging, in respect to our animations can best be described as 
              composition. Guiding the users eyes to the most important parts of the screen 
              through the use of motion.

  These are the rest of princiapls for reference, if you want to make more cards: 

  Principal 4: Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose
  Description: Within CSS, there are two methods for creating animations: 
  transitions and keyframes. Transitions are based on a starting and ending value 
  that the browser animates between. But with keyframes, we can add animations in 
  stages, or poses.

  Principal 5: Follow Through and Overlapping Action
  Description: Real objects don't have uniform density and mass, and thus will 
  accelerate and decelerate at different rates. Think of being in a car and having 
  our heads snapped back into the headrest as it accelerates. Or having our heads 
  bounced forwards if the driver slammed on the brakes. Without follow through or 
  overlapping action, we would remain static within the car as it changed speed. 
  By giving different parts of an object different velocities, our animations will 
  feel more authentic.

  Principal 6: Slow in and slow out
  Description: Also known as "ease-in" and "ease-out," this principle is based on the 
  fact that physical objects don't simply start and stop instantaneously. They 
  accelerate and decelerate. Slow in refers to the acceleration of an object, and slow 
  out refers to deceleration. By applying different values to our eases can change the 
  perception of size or mass of an object. We can make things seem zippier or more 
  cumbersome depending on the the profiles of the acceleration and deceleration.

  Principal 7: Arc
  Description: It's said that nature doesn't make straight lines, and natural movements 
  are no exception. This is a bit trickier with the web's box model, but introducing 
  some arcs into the motion of objects can make them feel more natural.

  Principal 8: Secondary Action
  Description: Adding individual animations to separate pieces of a scene can help to 
  accentuate or strengthen the primary elements of the animation.

  Principal 9: Timing
  Description: Objects should move at believable rates in comparison to their sizes and 
  mass. A semi-truck is going to accelerate and decelerate more slowly and evenly than a 
  Ferrari, which can get up to speed in the blink of an eye and stop on a dime. We 
  control the timing of objects both through their relative sizes, as well as  the 
  duration of an animation, as well as its ease-in and ease-out profiles.

  Principal 10: Exaggeration
  Description: While we're trying to keep our animations relatable, making them too 
  realistic can result in motion that is dry and unappealing. Pushing our the individual 
  principles of animation a bit beyond the natural limits can help to bestow them with 
  character and personality.

  Principal 11: Solid Drawing
  Description: Traditionally, this principle refers to properly realizing a scene, such 
  as properly rendering perspective, etc. For us, this principle is all about properly 
  structuring our code for animation. It's critical that we understand the ins and outs 
  of the properties that we are using, in order to ensure that our animations are playing 
  back as desired.

  Principal 12: Appeal
  Description: In a word: Charisma. Adding small flourishes to our animations can help 
  make them more dynamic and engaging to our users.  The life of the party is the life 
  of the party because they attract the attention of the room. It's their appeal and 
  charisma that draws our attention to them and keeps it there.
